        <h1 id="who">WHO AM I?</h1>
        <p class="p1">Hello, my name is Matthew Salazar, and I am a second-year <span class="red">Computer Engineering</span> student at the <span class="red">University of Guelph</span>.</p>
        <p class="p1">Why computer engineering? My passion for computers started at a young age but grew significantly during my first dedicated computer engineering course in high school. This course provided me with a strong foundation in various skills such as creating virtual machines, networking, robotics, Arduino, and programming.</p>
        <p class="p1">During my first year at the <span class="red">University of Guelph</span>, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects. One notable project was the 'Teddy Bear Wheelchair,' where I utilized my skills to create an autonomous wheelchair for a teddy bear. Additionally, I developed a file processing system in Java and embarked on personal projects, including a Robotic Hand. You can find more information about these projects in the 'projects' section.</p>
        <p id="p2">I am actively searching for internship opportunities for <span class="red">Summer 2024</span>.</p>

The hand utilizes the nRF24L01 wireless communication module and is controlled by Arduino Nanos. Used Solidworks to design custom parts such as the palm, forearm and servo bed. In order to organize and connect the electrical components, I employed a PCB. All assembly drawings as well as pictures of the project can be found via the PDF</p>
