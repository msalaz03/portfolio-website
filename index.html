        <p class="p1">Hello, my name is Matthew Salazar, and I am a second-year <span class="red">Computer Engineering</span> student at the <span class="red">University of Guelph</span>.</p>
        <p class="p1">Why <span class="red">computer engineering</span>? My passion for computers started at a young age but grew significantly during my first dedicated computer engineering course in high school. This course provided me with a strong foundation in various skills such as creating virtual machines, networking, robotics, Arduino, and programming.</p>
        <p class="p1">During my first year at the <span class="red">University of Guelph</span>, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects. One notable project was the 'Teddy Bear Wheelchair,' where I utilized my skills to create an autonomous wheelchair for a teddy bear. Additionally, I developed a file processing system in Java and embarked on personal projects, including a Robotic Hand. You can find more information about these projects in the 'projects' section.</p>
        <p id="p2">I am actively searching for internship opportunities for the <span class="red">summer of '24</span>'.</p>
